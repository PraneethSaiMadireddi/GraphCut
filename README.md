# Graphcut Textures: Image and Video Synthesis Using Graph Cuts

## Installation

The implementation is in Python 3.

Install the required Python packages using the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
Command to generate new textures:
  ```
  python3 graphcut.py
  ```
  
I have saved Adjacency matrices that are generated in a separate folder for the reference.

I also saved Pixels data in the pixels directory for your reference.

Finally the generated image from the graphcut is saved in images/generated_images directory.
